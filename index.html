            <p>Theyyam is a spectacular ritual dance form from the northern districts of Kerala, India. This ancient
                tradition transforms ordinary performers into living gods through elaborate masks, costumes, and divine
                possession.</p>

                <h3>What makes Theyyam Special?</h3>
                <p>Unlike other dance forms, Theyyam is not just entertainment - it's a sacred ritual where the
                    performer becomes the deity. People believe that during the performance, the dancer is actually
                    possessed by the god or goddess they represent.</p>

            <h3>Ancient Beginnings</h3>
            <p>Theyyam originated over 1500 years ago in the Malabar region of Kerala. The word "Theyyam" comes from
                "Deivam," which means God in Malayalam. This art form has its roots in ancient tribal worship and folk
                traditions.</p>

            <h3>Historical Development</h3>
            <p>Initially, Theyyam was performed by lower caste communities as a form of worship to local deities and
                ancestral spirits. Over centuries, it evolved into a sophisticated art form while maintaining its sacred
                character.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Historical Facts</h3>
                <p>The earliest references to Theyyam can be found in ancient Malayalam literature from the 12th
                    century. However, the tradition itself is much older, with some scholars tracing it back to
                    prehistoric times.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Evolution Through Time</h3>
            <p>During the medieval period, Theyyam incorporated elements from various religious traditions including
                Hinduism, Buddhism, and local tribal beliefs. This fusion created the rich, diverse tradition we see
                today.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Sacred Stories</h3>
            <p>Each Theyyam form has its own unique story, usually about a local hero, deity, or ancestral spirit. These
                stories often involve themes of justice, protection of the innocent, and divine intervention.</p>

            <div class="grid">
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Pottan Theyyam</h3>
                    <p>Represents a Brahmin who was killed unjustly. His spirit became a protective deity who helps
                        people in need.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Gulikan Theyyam</h3>
                    <p>A fierce form representing the son of Lord Shiva, known for protecting devotees from evil forces.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">

                    <p>Represents Goddess Durga in her fierce form, symbolizing the victory of good over evil.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Social Significance</h3>
            <p>Theyyam serves as a bridge between different social classes. During performances, the usual social
                hierarchy is reversed - the performer, often from a lower caste, becomes a god whom everyone, including
                upper-caste people, worships.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Cultural Values</h3>
                <p>Theyyam promotes values of equality, justice, and community harmony. It teaches that divinity can
                    manifest in anyone, regardless of their social status.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Spiritual Beliefs</h3>
            <p>People believe that during Theyyam performances, the deities actually come to earth to bless devotees,
                solve problems, and provide guidance. This makes each performance a deeply spiritual experience.</p>

                    <p>Some Theyyam costumes can weigh up to 30-40 kg and reach heights of 10-15 feet, making the

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Preparation Process</h3>
                <p>It takes 4-6 hours to completely dress a performer in Theyyam costume. The process itself is
                    considered sacred, with specific rituals performed at each stage.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Makeup and Face Painting</h3>
            <p>Before wearing masks, performers undergo elaborate face painting using natural colors. The designs are
                specific to each deity and are considered as important as the mask itself.</p>
